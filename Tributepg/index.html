            <p>1981: A star was born.</p>

            <p>He was born on July 25.
                He was always interested in helping others with kindness.</p>
            
            <p>I started admiring you when I was a child and you became my inspiration too. I am really inspired by the way you help others.</p>
            <p>People who express their good wishes, often to someone they do not know, are known as well-wishers, so you are always my well-wisher. He was an admirable person because he not only helped others but also helped his mother fight against her diseases.</p>
            <p>The true well-wisher is the one who talks about your weaknesses in front of you and proudly talks about your strengths in front of others.</p>              
            <p>Well-wishers are nothing but the strength of our lives and the pillars of our happiness. WELL is a formation of wisdom, ethics, loyalty, and legal characteristics of thoughts as we start to grow and learn to drive our lives.</p>
            <p>I will always admire you  !!!!</p>
